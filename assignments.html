                    <h3>The history of the internet</h3>
                    <p><strong>History</strong></p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I have chosen to write about video games because it is of great interest to me and it’s success is deeply intertwined with the development of the internet. Video games are mainly used for recreational purposes but in later years it has also led to different professions such as E-sports and online entertainers. Video games were for a time solely available in arcades but have since then become more and more personal. Now video games are available on pretty much any computing platform from gaming consoles to phones and tablets. Video games can also be used as educational platforms and are commonly used to improve learning with challenged students. <br><br>
                    With the development of the internet, the way video games are now shared, bought and played, is entirely different than before the internets arrival. Previously you would have to go to a store to buy the game you would like to purchase, now it can merely be done with a few clicks on different online marketplaces such as the Xbox-store, Google-play or Steam. After you’ve bought whatever game it is you want, you can download it and play once the download is finished. <br><br>
                    The internet hasn’t just changed the way we purchase games though. It has also completely revolutionized the way games work and play. You can now compare statistics and achievements with your friends or the rest of the world. Use integrated social aspects in games such as friend systems, chats or gifts. Read news articles, watch trailers or even turn it into a profession, but most importantly, the internet has brought us online multiplayer. Earlier you would have to be connected to the same network to able to play together with someone else, but thanks to the internet it can now be done across the globe. To play with someone you merely need to invite them to your group, or use a matchmaking service that matches you with other players searching for people to play with. <br><br>
                    The world of video games is constantly evolving, with new technology being developed all year round the technological limits for video games reaches new heights every year and will most likely keep going for quite a while. When it comes to the internet’s involvement with video games however, it is hard to say whether or not it ends here. Some might say we’ve already discovered every use there is for the internet when it comes to video games but we cannot truly know if there’s anything left to discover until we’ve discovered it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Society</strong></p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The world of video games has a great deal of people involved in it ranging from people playing video games on their free time to the people developing the games and systems for a living. Video games have also led to the development of an entertainment scene where people play video games as a profession. So video games isn’t just an international hobby, but also a source of income for a lot of people all around the world. Even though the world of video games is rather large and almost everyone knows it exists, there is a surprisingly small amount of people who know anything about it. Most people are not directly affected by video games and it’s development but it has helped in the development of several services. For example online live streaming is dominated by gaming streams and online video sharing sites like youtube have a large audience for gaming content. Furthermore video games have influenced the development of broadband systems, the fastest ever recorded download speed was provided by Com Hem to the gaming LAN Dreamhack in Jönköping Sweden in 2018, at 1.6 Terabit/s (2). <br><br>
                    If videogames were to suddenly disappear it would most likely return within a month since it is not just made up out of one product, but several thousands of products developed by different people all around the world. If however, all videogames were to disappear and no new ones were to emerge, the most notable consequence would be the many companies that would be out of business. Gaming hardware manufacturers, game developers, Esports organisations and other gaming related companies would be out of business instantaneously. Beyond that many people would lose their jobs, not just the employees of the companies going out of business, but also the online entertainers and professional players merely playing the games for a living. So no matter how large of an impact it would have on the economy, it would decrease the circulation of money and raise unemployment rates. <br><br>
                    My everyday life is very influenced by video games. I spend most of my free time playing games with my friends, as well as watching other people do it. It has become such a big hobby for me that i hope to somehow turn my passion for video games into a profession, so if videogames were to disappear my everyday would look very different. I would probably spend more time playing tabletop games or sports and get myself a new hobby like airsoft, as well as hang out more with my friends in real life, instead of chatting online. This in turn might have a positive outcome, since i would probably involve myself in more physical exercise and socialise more, but I would lose the passion that i have for video games which keeps me longing to get home at the end of the day.</p>
                    <p><strong>Functionality</strong></p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>When you play a game online the game client is communicating with a server located somewhere on the internet, typically this server is relatively nearby to minimize latency(4)(5)(1 page 23-37). The session between the client and server is also encrypted to keep it private and minimize tampering(1 page 67-74). There can be different servers for different services in the game. For example there can be a matchmaking server that keeps track of all currently searching players, that then redirects the players to the actual game server when enough players have met the criteria. These criteria can be what game mode the players are searching for as well as player rank(6). There can also be private hosted servers, especially in survival games. These servers are can be either peer-to-peer servers that are run in the same kind of client as the game, or dedicated servers that run a different client for the game than the player that don’t include elements that are unnecessary server side such as graphics(4). There are some games that don’t include multiplayer, but still have some servers for other features in the game. This can be for example singleplayer challenges, where you complete a task and compare the statistics to another player doing the same task.</p>
